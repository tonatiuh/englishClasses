Proposal

As a result of the investigation that I've just made, I realized that it will be good if we get some new items for the company, due to with that we can improve our development using them. That investigation shows that if we buy some new 24" HD monitors, our production will be increased by 30%.

Nowadays, the developers from the company are getting some neck pains because of the small screens. It's a fact that when you work on a small screen it is not so much more ergonomic, which makes the developers get frustrated more easily.

If we keep producing with the same quality level then our profit will enhance in an 50%, which minds that because of the price of the monitors it will be a pretty good inversion. As the monitors cost 250 dollars and we need a total of fifteen monitors, the total inversion that the company will need will be of 3750 dollars.
