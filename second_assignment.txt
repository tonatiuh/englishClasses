Proposal

Based on a recent investigation that I've just made, I analize that it will be good if we get some new items for the company, due to with these new items we can improve our performance. An important result of my investigation is that our production can be increased by a 30% if we change the old new 24" HD monitors.

Nowadays, the developers from the company are getting some neck pains because they are working on the small screens. It's a fact that when you work on a small screen it is not so much more ergonomic, which makes the developers get frustrated more easily.

If we keep producing with the same quality level then our profit will enhance in an 50%, which means that because of the price of the monitors it will be a pretty good investment. The total investment will be 3750 USD, that is because each monitor costs 250 USD, and we will need a total of fifteen monitors.
