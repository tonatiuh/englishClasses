To whom it may concern

On September 15th, I bought headphones with one of your distributors located at the sucursal on Av. Galvan #24, however I have had issues with some headphones that I just bought the last September 15 with one of your distributor.

In order to solve this problem I wrote to the camplain department that you have here in Colima without having a positive solution. Therefore I would like that you take care of the situation.

Let me comment you, the first problem that they presented were some detatchs in the pad on the diadem, after that, one day they just began to break from one of the diadem sides. In consequence, I would like to have a replacement of the item as soon as possible. 

My warranty number is 89478 and also, my telephone number is 312 323 4323 in case you need to call me.

In case that you could not replace the item I would appreciate a refound of my purchase.

I look forward to your replay and a resolution to my problem.
